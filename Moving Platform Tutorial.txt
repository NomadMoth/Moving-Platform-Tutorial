To start, create three variables, one public array for the waypoints, one private integer which will allow
the user to choose how many waypoints they wish to have in the inspector, and a public float to allow control
over the speed of movement for the platform.

You should have something like this:

	public GameObject[] waypoints;
    private int currentWaypointIndex = 0;
    public float speed = 2f;
	
In the update function, create an if statement. Within this statement will be the conditions that must be met
for the platform to travel between waypoints.

void Update()
    {
        // This checks whether the platforms is close enough to perform the
        // next statement
        if (Vector3.Distance(waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].transform.position,
            transform.position) < .1f)
        {
            // This adds one to the index, switching waypoint targets for the platform
            currentWaypointIndex++;
            
            // This resets the index to the beginning, resulting in the platform returning
            // to the first waypoint
            if (currentWaypointIndex >= waypoints.Length)
            {
                currentWaypointIndex = 0;
            }
        }
        // This moves the platform to the currently designated waypoint
        transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(transform.position, waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].transform.position, Time.deltaTime * speed);
    }
